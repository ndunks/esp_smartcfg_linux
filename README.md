__About:__

This is a command line version of the ESPTouch SmartConfig App (https://github.com/EspressifApp/EsptouchForAndroid) written in C.
Completely stand-alone implementation without any dependencies to external libraries, especially from the original App.
* Works on Raspberry.
* Works on Windows.
* Implemented but not tested for hidden Wifis.
* AES is not implemented, however it is uncertain how that is used at all - i cant figure out from the App's source where the AES-key is handled.

__Build:__

Build via `make`, then a local subdirectory `./bin` appears with the executeable `smartcfg`.

__Usage:__
```
smartcfg ...
  [ --essid ESSID ]
  [ --bssid BSSID ]
  --password PASSWORD
  [ (--interface INTERFACENAME) | (--address LOCALADDRESS) ]
  [ (--timeout TIMEOUT) | --infinite ]
  [ --hidden | --visible ]

```

* If `--interface` is ommitted, then `wlan0` is assumed. (works only on linux)
* If `--address` is ommitted, then the local address of the interface is used. (works only on linux)
* If `--essid` and `--bssid` are ommitted, then the locally connected Wifi is used (works only on linux). You will typically _only_ provide these parameters, if you want to put your ESP into a _different_ wifi of the one, your Raspi is currently booked in. Of course this requires providing the correct password of this wifi.
* The `--password` must always be given.  

__Example:__
```
pi@raspiz1% ./bin/smartcfg --password "34234673423423"
./bin/smartcfg, ver: May 19 2019/15:20:49 ...
using local interface wlan0 address 192.168.0.141
using ssid MyWifiName (9c:c7:a6:9c:f7:84)
